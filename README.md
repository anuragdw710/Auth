## Auth microservice

- This project aims to create a robust authentication service using Node.js with JSON Web Token (JWT) for secure authentication and authorization.
- JWT Authentication provides a stateless solution, enabling clients to authenticate themselves with the server using a token-based approach, eliminating the need for session management on the server side.

## Key Features:
- User Registration and Login:
- JWT Generation and Verification
- Middleware for Authorization
- Password Hashing
- Error Handling

## Set Up
